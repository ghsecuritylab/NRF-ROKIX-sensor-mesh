# Contributing

File bug reports and feature requests as issues using GitHub's issue
tracker. Use the `bug` tag for bugs and `enhancement` for feature requests.

Development happens in the master branch. Ensure that patches apply cleanly to
it.

### Pull Request Process

Use pull requests for bug fixes and other changes.

1. Fork the project, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/xxxx.git

2. Make your change(s).

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

### Code style

Write code using the style of the surrounding code.

### Commit message

Try to keep the first line of the commit message shorter than 72 characters. The
first line should describe what the change is and the body should describe the
problem that the commit is addressing and how the commit improves the situation.
